Text Mining and Feature Extraction: Identification of recurring patterns, common phrases, and linguistic features within email content.
NLP Analysis: Application of sentiment analysis and Named Entity Recognition (NER) to understand the emotional tone and context of emails.
Template Generation: Development of machine learning algorithms that generate standardized email templates, adaptable to different communication contexts and user preferences.
